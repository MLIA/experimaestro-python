# Experimental plan

An experimental plan is based on [configuration and tasks](../experiments/config), and define which tasks should be run with which parameters. Within an experiment, [tags](../experiments/plan#tags) can be used to mark tracked experimental parameters.


# Connectors 

A [connector](../connectors) allow to specify how to access files on the computer where a task will be launched, and how to run processes on this computer. 

# Launcher

A [launcher](../launchers) specifies how a given task can be run.
