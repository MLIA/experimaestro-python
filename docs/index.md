# Introduction

Experimaestro is a computer science experiment manager whose goals are:

* To decompose experiments into a set of parameterizable tasks
* Schedule tasks and handle dependencies between tasks
* Avoids to re-run the same task two times by computing unique task IDs dependending on the parameters
* Handle experimental parameters through tags
